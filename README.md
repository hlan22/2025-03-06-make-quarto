# DSCI 310: Makefiles and Websites Lecture
### Date Created: 2025-03-06

Thanks to Daniel Chen and the DSCI 310 class at UBC for this lecture and information!

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This repo is NOT finished. 
I still need to fix the errors associated with the name changes and file additions, 
as well as rendering the final index.html so that the website link works**

## Main Ideas

Here is a list of the important concepts we learned in class:

* Good structures to have in large repos
* Websites are very useful for people that just want to view the final result, without knowing the code that went into it, etc.
  * It is also much easier to send a fully independent html file than a zip code with a ton of information
* Website basics
  * what a `.nojekyll` file is and it's purpose
  * what a `_quarto.yml` file is and it's purpose
  * the difference between a website made from the `root/` folder or the `docs/` folder
* The usefulness of keeping a file, such as `output/` empty with a `.gitkeep` file
* etc.
